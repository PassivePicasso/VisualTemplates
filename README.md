# VisualTemplates
An automatic templating and binding system for rapid UIElements composition

~~Work in progress~~ (This project is effectively abandoned, if the concepts here are revisted they will likely be reimplemented)

This is designed against Unity 2020.1a8 and isn't being developed for backwards compatible support, 
Of course, you can always fork the code to get this working on older versions, there are only a few modifications I'm aware of.

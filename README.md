# VisualTemplates
An automatic templating and binding system for rapid UIElements composition

Work in progress

This is designed against Unity 2020.1a8 and isn't being developed for backwards compatible support, 
Of course, you can always fork the code to get this working on older versions, there are only a few modifications I'm aware of.
